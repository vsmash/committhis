**MAIASS** (Modular AI-Augmented Semantic Scribe) is an intelligent Git workflow automation script that streamlines version management, changelog generation, and deployment processes with optional AI-powered commit message suggestions.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Version Management**: Automatic semantic versioning with support for multiple file formats
- **AI-Powered Commit Messages**: Optional OpenAI integration for intelligent commit message generation
- **Automated Changelog Generation**: Keep your project history organized and professional
- **Multi-Platform Git Integration**: Works with GitHub, Bitbucket, and any Git repository
- **Flexible Workflow Support**: Adapts to Git Flow, GitHub Flow, or custom branching strategies
- **Pull Request Automation**: Automatic PR URL generation and browser integration
- **Jira Integration**: Automatic ticket detection and inclusion in commits
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL/Git Bash)

## Quick Start

### Installation

**Homebrew (Recommended)**:
```bash
brew tap vsmash/homebrew-maiass
brew install maiass
```

**Manual Installation**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vsmash/maiass.git
cd maiass && ./install.sh
```

This will install both `maiass.sh` (symlinked as `maiass`, `myass`, and `miass`) and `committhis.sh` (symlinked as `committhis`) to your `~/.local/bin` directory if present.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# 5.5.2
maiass

# 5.5.2
maiass minor

# 5.5.2
maiass major

# 5.5.2
maiass 2.1.0

# 5.5.2
# 5.5.2
committhis
* committhis is already integrated into maiass. this is only 
for people who want to use the commit functionality on its 
own without the git flow, version managment and changelog generation

```

### AI-Powered Commit Messages

```bash
# 5.5.2
export MAIASS_AI_TOKEN="your_api_key"
export MAIASS_AI_MODE="ask"

# 5.5.2
maiass patch
```
